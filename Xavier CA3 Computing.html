<h3>T‑Mobile Scam Shield (U.S.)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Free service for T‑Mobile and Metro by T‑Mobile customers.</li>
  <li>Uses AI and network filters to block known “Scam Likely” calls before your phone rings.</li>
  <li>Shows caller ID for unknown numbers and verifies some business calls.</li>
  <li>Allows users to report suspicious calls, improving detection for everyone.</li>
  <li>Premium upgrade adds features: block specific numbers, block call categories (e.g., telemarketing), voicemail transcription, and reverse number lookup.</li>
  <li>Reduces spam and robocalls significantly, but may still miss spoofed or very new scam numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Singapore ScamShield</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Official, free government app designed to fight scams targeting Singapore users.</li>
  <li>Blocks calls from known scam numbers and filters scam SMS before they reach the user.</li>
  <li>Lets users check suspicious phone numbers, messages, or links to see if they match known scams.</li>
  <li>Users can anonymously submit reports and screenshots to help national anti‑scam efforts.</li>
  <li>Protects privacy by only scanning messages from unknown senders and not accessing private chats or contacts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
<p>Both apps provide an extra layer of protection by blocking known scams and giving users tools to identify and report suspicious content. 
However, users should still be cautious, as no system can fully block spoofed or highly targeted scams.</p>
